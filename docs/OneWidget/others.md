### 3. Why are you not a VIP after paying?
Please check whether the payment has been successfully deducted first. If the payment has been successfully deducted, but you are not a member yet, you can enter from the VIP membership page and click the [Resume Purchase] button to resume your membership.

### 4. Why did the purchase of membership fail?
Network delay causes the problem, if the payment has been successfully deducted, you can click the Resume Purchase button; if the unlocked premium version has not been shown after 24 hours after the payment has been deducted and cannot be resumed, please go to AppStore to refund or cancel the subscription in time.

### 5. Do I need to buy the premium version again if I change my phone after purchasing it?
If the Apple ID used in the new phone is the same as the Apple ID used in the previous purchase of the premium version, you can unlock the premium version by clicking Restore.
