### 1. The button to add the widget cannot be found on the desktop of the phone
The widget currently only supports iOS14 and above, please confirm and upgrade your phone system to iOS14 and above. If you are already on iOS14 and above, search for OneWidget in the widget list first, if you don't find it, try restarting your phone, opening the app to add a widget, and then try to find it on your desktop again.

### 2. How to display widgets on iPad desktop?
Currently, iPad widget iOS14 only supports displaying in today page. Slide to the first page of the home screen, and then slide from the leftmost side of the screen to the right to show the today view to view the widget. iOS15 and above support adding widgets on desktop, the process of adding is similar to iPhone.

### 3. What should I do if the desktop widget is stuck without updating, white screen, black screen or error?
This phenomenon often occurs when there is a problem with the phone's memory. In addition, it may also happen that the widget is not updated or error occurs because of the refresh mechanism of Apple system. In this case, you can click into the app and we will force to refresh it; if it is still invalid, you need to add the widget again or restart the phone and then add the widget again.

### 4. Can I remove the text of OneWidget under the widget?
OneWidget is the name of the app, and Apple Store requires our app to bring the name when reviewing, so the text of desktop OneWidget cannot be removed at present, and customization is not supported. If Apple supports related settings in the future, we will update it as soon as possible.

### 5. Why is the time widget not displayed accurately?
Due to Apple's system update mechanism, the clock data may be delayed for a certain period of time. You can click the clock widget and restart the app to use it normally.

### 6. Why there is no photo when I select photos in the album?
Open [Settings], search OneWidget, change the photo permission to all photos.

### 7. What about the second jump through the Quick Launch widget?
Due to Apple's system limitations, there is no direct way to open third-party applications for the time being, so you can only open third-party applications by jumping, if there is a more convenient shortcut we will update it in time.

### 8. What should I do if the transparent background is misplaced?

### 9. What should I do if the screenshot size is wrong?
Go to [Settings], find [Display & Brightness] → [View] → set it to standard, then take a new screenshot and upload it.
