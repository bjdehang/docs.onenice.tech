### 1. How to hide the original icon after installing the new one?
Go back to desktop and long press the home screen → click the small dot at the bottom and uncheck the page you want to hide - click Finish - the setting is finished.

### 2. Why can't I find the original APP after deleting the custom icons?
The APP is not deleted, only the custom icon is deleted, and the original APP is hidden in the APP library. You can swipe left on the home screen of your phone to the APP library and find the APP.

### 3. How to delete new icons in batch?
Go to [Settings] General → Search [VPN & Device Management] → Click the relevant topic and remove the description file.

### 4. How come there is no new message alert after I changed the icon?
Changing the icon is equivalent to adding a shortcut, so at this stage we do not have permission to get your new message notification and alert you.

Go to [Settings] → scroll down to find [Accessibility] → click [Dynamic Effect] → open [Diminish Dynamic Effect], which can reduce the time of second jump and present the effect of opening the app quickly!

Open [Settings] → find [Safari] → slide to the bottom and click [Advanced] → open [JavaScript] → return to OneWidget APP → click the refresh button in the upper right corner → click "Download description file" again → it can be downloaded normally.

### 7. How to turn off the lock screen countdown and automatic wallpaper change?
